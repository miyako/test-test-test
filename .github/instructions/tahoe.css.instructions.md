# 4D Liquid Glass & Form Theme CSS — Agent Rules

## Overview

Starting with macOS Tahoe (macOS 26) and 4D 21 R3, Apple's Liquid Glass visual language is applied automatically to 4D desktop applications. While no code changes are strictly required, some controls — particularly push buttons — need height adjustments to render correctly with the new appearance. This document describes how to use CSS media queries with `form-theme` to adapt form object sizing and styling per platform theme.

---

## Form Theme Media Queries

4D supports the `form-theme` media feature in CSS stylesheets. This allows you to write theme-specific rules that apply automatically based on the active platform rendering.

### Available `form-theme` Values

| Value | Platform | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `liquid-glass` | macOS Tahoe+ | Apple's translucent Liquid Glass rendering |
| `mac-classic` | macOS (pre-Tahoe or compatibility mode) | Traditional macOS control rendering |
| `fluent-ui` | Windows 11+ | Microsoft Fluent UI rendering |
| `win-classic` | Windows (classic) | Traditional Windows control rendering |

### Available `prefers-color-scheme` Values

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `light` | Light colour scheme |
| `dark` | Dark colour scheme |

> **Note:** Colour schemes are not supported with the `win-classic` platform theme.

### Syntax

```css
@media (form-theme: liquid-glass) {
    /* macOS Tahoe Liquid Glass rules */
}

@media (form-theme: mac-classic) {
    /* classic macOS rules */
}

@media (form-theme: fluent-ui) {
    /* Windows Fluent UI rules */
}

@media (form-theme: win-classic) {
    /* classic Windows rules */
}
```

Media queries can be nested for theme + colour scheme combinations:

```css
@media (form-theme: fluent-ui) {
    .myClass {
        stroke: #2A2A2A;
    }

    @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
        .myClass {
            stroke: #E0E0E0;
        }
    }
}
```

## Stylesheet Files and Loading Order

4D automatically loads stylesheets from `Project/Sources/` in this order:

1. `styleSheets.css` — cross-platform (loaded first)
2. `styleSheets_mac.css` — macOS only (overrides cross-platform)
3. `styleSheets_windows.css` — Windows only (overrides cross-platform)
4. Form-specific CSS via the `"css"` property in `form.4DForm` (loaded last, highest CSS priority)

### Where to Place Theme Rules

| Rule scope | File |
|-----------|------|
| Cross-platform (dark mode, colour scheme) | `styleSheets.css` |
| macOS-only (Liquid Glass vs mac-classic) | `styleSheets_mac.css` |
| Windows-only (Fluent UI vs win-classic) | `styleSheets_windows.css` |
| Form-specific overrides | Referenced via `"css"` property in the form JSON |

## Button Sizing for Liquid Glass

### The Problem

In Liquid Glass, push buttons have two visual variants based on height:

- **Regular variant** — square corners (shorter buttons)
- **Large variant** — rounded corners with Liquid Glass translucency (taller buttons)

The switch between these variants occurs at a **one-pixel threshold**. A button must be at least **27px high** to receive the rounded Liquid Glass appearance.

Many legacy forms use hardcoded button heights of 20px or 23px. These render as flat, square buttons under Liquid Glass, which looks inconsistent with the rest of the Tahoe UI.

### The Fix

Use CSS media queries in `styleSheets_mac.css` to set appropriate button heights per theme:

```css
@media (form-theme: liquid-glass) {
    button.default {
        height: 27px;
    }
}

@media (form-theme: mac-classic) {
    button.default {
        height: 23px;
    }
}
```

### Mandatory Audit Scope: Every Button in Every Form

Button height is a project-wide concern, not a single-form concern. Before
declaring this migration done, you **must** enumerate every button in
**every** `form.4DForm` file in the project — not just the form you happen
to be looking at, and not just the first button you notice.

```
grep -rn '"type": "button"' Project/Sources/Forms/ Project/Sources/TableForms/
```

For each match, check the enclosing object for a `height` (or `bottom`)
property and a `class` property. A button is only "done" once **both**:

1. `height`/`bottom` has been removed, and
2. `"class": "default"` (or the appropriate class) has been added.

**This was missed in practice**: an earlier pass added `"class": "default"`
and removed `height` from `BtnDemo` on the `HDI` form, verified that no
*other* object used that class yet, and stopped there — without checking
whether *other buttons on other forms* (`HDI2`'s `btnHelloWorld`, `Button1`,
`btnOpenListForm`, `btnOpenOutputJSON`, `btnOpenInputJSON`) needed the exact
same treatment. Those five buttons kept their hardcoded `height: 20`/`21`
and rendered as flat, square buttons under Liquid Glass while `BtnDemo`
alone got the rounded look — an inconsistent, half-finished migration that
went unnoticed because the search scope was one form instead of the whole
project.

**Rule:** "verified only `BtnDemo` uses this class" is not a stopping
point — it is a prompt to go find every *other* button that should also use
it. Grep the whole `Project/Sources/Forms/` and `Project/Sources/TableForms/`
tree for `"type": "button"` and resolve every single hit before considering
the task complete.

### Critical: CSS Specificity vs Form JSON

Properties defined directly in the `.4DForm` JSON have **the highest specificity** and override CSS rules — unless the CSS uses `!important` (which is discouraged).

Therefore, for CSS-driven sizing to work:

1. **Remove** the `height` property from the button definition in `form.4DForm`
2. **Remove** the `bottom` property if present (it implicitly constrains height)
3. **Keep only** positioning properties: `top`, `left`, `width` (or `right`)
4. **Add** a `"class"` property to the button (e.g., `"class": "default"`) so the CSS selector matches

**Before (CSS will NOT take effect):**
```json
"MyButton": {
    "type": "button",
    "top": 520,
    "left": 614,
    "width": 90,
    "height": 20,
    "text": "OK"
}
```

**After (CSS controls height):**
```json
"MyButton": {
    "type": "button",
    "top": 520,
    "left": 614,
    "width": 90,
    "text": "OK",
    "class": "default"
}
```

### Choosing a CSS Class Name

Use a class name that reflects the button's role or style tier. Common conventions:

| Class | Use case |
|-------|----------|
| `default` | Standard push buttons (Demo, OK, Cancel, etc.) |
| `toolbar` | Toolbar-style buttons with different sizing |
| `small` | Intentionally compact buttons |

You may combine type and class selectors in CSS: `button.default` targets only buttons with the `default` class — it will not affect other object types.

## Adapting Other Controls

### Radio Buttons and Checkboxes

Under Liquid Glass, radio buttons and checkboxes render slightly larger. Review spacing and alignment around these controls to ensure they do not overlap adjacent objects.

### Combo Boxes

Combo boxes use translucent rendering under Liquid Glass, meaning background objects may show through. If overlapping objects exist behind a combo box, adjust their visibility or z-order to prevent visual clutter.

### Sequences of Buttons

If a form contains multiple buttons in a row, ensure they all have **consistent heights**. A one-pixel difference can cause some buttons to render as square and others as rounded, creating a visually jarring mix.

---

## Runtime Theme Detection

The `FORM theme` command (`:C2conveniently`) returns the current rendering mode as a string at runtime. Possible return values include:

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `"liquidGlass"` | Liquid Glass is active |
| `"classic"` | Classic rendering |

Use this when you need to adjust behaviour programmatically beyond what CSS can handle — for example, dynamically setting meta-source colours in listboxes.

```4d
If (FORM theme:C2107="liquidGlass")
    // adjust programmatic styling for Liquid Glass
End if
```

> **Prefer CSS over runtime detection** whenever possible. CSS media queries are declarative, automatic, and require no method code.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ❌ Leaving `height` in the form JSON when using CSS

```json
"height": 20,
"class": "default"
```

**Why:** The JSON property overrides CSS. The button will remain 20px regardless of your CSS rules.

### ❌ Using `!important` to override form JSON heights

```css
button.default {
    height: 27px !important;
}
```

**Why:** While this works, it makes the CSS harder to maintain and override later. Remove the property from the JSON instead.

### ❌ Using `bottom` to constrain height

```json
"top": 520,
"bottom": 540
```

**Why:** The `top` + `bottom` combination implicitly defines height. Remove `bottom` and let CSS control height.

### ❌ Hardcoding a single height without theme differentiation

```css
button.default {
    height: 27px;
}
```

**Why:** This gives 27px on classic macOS too, where 23px is the standard button height. Always use media queries to set theme-appropriate values.

### ❌ Putting macOS-specific rules in `styleSheets.css`

```css
/* In styleSheets.css — WRONG */
@media (form-theme: liquid-glass) {
    button.default { height: 27px; }
}
```

**Why:** `liquid-glass` and `mac-classic` are macOS-only themes. Place them in `styleSheets_mac.css`. Similarly, `fluent-ui` and `win-classic` rules belong in `styleSheets_windows.css`. Cross-platform rules (e.g., `prefers-color-scheme`) belong in `styleSheets.css`.

### ❌ Inconsistent button heights in a button group

```json
"BtnOK":     { "type": "button", "height": 27 },
"BtnCancel": { "type": "button", "height": 26 }
```

**Why:** A one-pixel difference causes one button to render rounded and the other square under Liquid Glass. Always use the same class and let CSS set a consistent height.

### ❌ Forgetting the `class` property on buttons

Creating a CSS rule for `button.default` but not adding `"class": "default"` to the button in the form JSON. The rule will not match.

### ❌ Migrating only the first form/button you find

```
# WRONG — stopping after fixing one button on one form
"BtnDemo" in HDI/form.4DForm → fixed
(HDI2/form.4DForm never checked)
```

**Why:** This is exactly what happened in practice: `BtnDemo` on the `HDI`
form was migrated (class added, height removed) and the change was verified
by confirming no *other object* used the same class yet — but that
verification was mistaken for "done" instead of "no other button uses this
class **yet**, so go find the ones that should." Five buttons on the `HDI2`
form (`btnHelloWorld`, `Button1`, `btnOpenListForm`, `btnOpenOutputJSON`,
`btnOpenInputJSON`) were left with hardcoded `height` and no `class`,
rendering flat/square while `BtnDemo` alone rendered rounded. Always grep
`Project/Sources/Forms/` and `Project/Sources/TableForms/` for every
`"type": "button"` project-wide before considering the migration complete —
see "Mandatory Audit Scope" above.

## Disabling Liquid Glass (Merged Applications Only)

For merged (engine-based) applications that need a transition period, add the `UIDesignRequiresCompatibility` key to the application's `Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>UIDesignRequiresCompatibility</key>
<true/>
```

This retains the classic visual style while you adapt interfaces. This key has **no effect** on 4D and 4D Server applications — they always use Liquid Glass on macOS 26+.

---

## 4D CSS Property Reference (Relevant Subset)

4D CSS uses **4D property names in camelCase**, not standard HTML/CSS property names. Some properties accept alternative CSS names:

| 4D property | CSS alternative | Purpose |
|------------|----------------|---------|
| `fill` | `background-color` | Background colour |
| `stroke` | `color` | Text/foreground colour |
| `fontFamily` | `font-family` | Font |
| `fontSize` | `font-size` | Font size |
| `fontWeight` | `font-weight` | Bold/normal |
| `fontStyle` | `font-style` | Italic/normal |
| `textAlign` | `text-align` | Alignment |
| `textDecoration` | `text-decoration` | Underline, etc. |
| `verticalAlign` | `vertical-align` | Vertical alignment |
| `borderStyle` | `border-style` | Border rendering |
| `borderRadius` | *(4D name only)* | Corner radius |
| `height` | *(4D name only)* | Object height |
| `width` | *(4D name only)* | Object width |
| `visibility` | *(4D name only)* | `"visible"` or `"hidden"` |
| `alternateFill` | *(4D name only)* | Listbox alternate row background |

> **Important:** 4D does **not** support alpha channel in hex colours. Use `#RRGGBB` (6 digits), not `#RRGGBBAA`.

## Checklist

When adapting a 4D project for Liquid Glass button support:

- [ ] Ran `grep -rn '"type": "button"' Project/Sources/Forms/ Project/Sources/TableForms/` and accounted for **every** result across **every** form — not just the form initially in scope
- [ ] `styleSheets_mac.css` exists in `Project/Sources/`
- [ ] `@media (form-theme: liquid-glass)` rule sets `height: 27px` for target button class
- [ ] `@media (form-theme: mac-classic)` rule sets `height: 23px` for target button class
- [ ] All target buttons in `form.4DForm` have `"class"` assigned (e.g., `"default"`)
- [ ] `height` property removed from target buttons in `form.4DForm`
- [ ] `bottom` property removed from target buttons in `form.4DForm` (if present)
- [ ] Only `top`, `left`, `width` (or `right`) remain as positioning properties
- [ ] All buttons in a visual group use the same class for consistent rendering
- [ ] No `!important` used to override JSON-defined heights (remove from JSON instead)
- [ ] Radio buttons and checkboxes reviewed for spacing under Liquid Glass
- [ ] Combo boxes reviewed for background transparency under Liquid Glass
- [ ] macOS-specific rules are in `styleSheets_mac.css`, not `styleSheets.css`
- [ ] Windows-specific rules (if any) are in `styleSheets_windows.css`
